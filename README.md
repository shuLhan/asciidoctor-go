# asciidoctor-go

The asciidoctor-go is the Go module to parse the
[AsciiDoc markup](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc)
and convert it into HTML5.

For the front-end tooling that use this library to build static website
see
[ciigo](https://sr.ht/~shulhan/ciigo).


##  Documentation

See the
[Go module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/git.sr.ht/~shulhan/asciidoctor-go)
for the API and examples on how to use this library to parse and render
Asciidoc file.

During reverse engineering the AsciiDoc markup, we write the syntax, rules,
and format in
[specification file](SPECS.html).

##  Notes

### Unsupported markup

The following markup will not supported either because its functionality is
duplicate, or inconsistent with others markup, or not secure,

* Header
  * Subtitle partitioning.
    Rationale: duplicate with the "Main: sub" format

* Tables
  * Nested tables.
    Rationale: nested table is not a good way to present information,
    never should it be.
  * Using different cell separator

* Includes
  * [Include Content by Tagged Regions](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-tagged-regions/)
    Rationale: the parser would need to know the language to be included and
    parse the whole source code to check for comments and tags.
  * [Include Content by URI](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-uri/)
    Rationale: security and unreliable network connections.


###  Unordered list item with hyphen

The unordered list item with hyphen ('-') cause too much confusion and
inconsistency.

Case one, given the following markup,

```
- Item 1
+
"A line
of quote"
-- Author
```

Is the "Author" the sub item in list or we are parsing author of quote
paragraph?

Case two, the writer want to write em dash (`&#8212;` in HTML Unicode) but
somehow the editor wrap it and start in new line.

As a reminder, the official documentation only recommend using hyphen for
simple list item

> You should reserve the hyphen for lists that only have a single level
> because the hyphen marker (-) doesnâ€™t work for nested lists.
