== asciidoctor-go v0.1.0 (2021-03-06)

The asciidoctor-go is the Go module to parse the AsciiDoc (TM) markup
and convert it into HTML5.

This first release bring almost all AsciiDoc syntax except for include
directive, inter-document cross-reference, macros, and non-primary syntax
features.

I hope this library can be useful for Gophers who need the power of AsciiDoc
in their workflows.
