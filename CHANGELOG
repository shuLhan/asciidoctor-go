[#v0_4_1]
== asciidoctor-go v0.4.1 (2023-03-03)

[#v0_4_1__bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

all: fix empty line printed on ToHTMLBody or ToHTMLEmbedded::
+
--
Given the following adoc,

----
= T
----

If we call ToHTMLBody, the output is

----
(empty line here)
<div id="header">
<h1>T</h1>
----

This changes remove the empty line at the top.
--


all: ignore parsing block image in paragraph::
+
--
Previously, if we have block image in paragraph, we parse it as inline
image but with invalid src, for example

----
image::my.png[multi
line].
----

would be parsed as <img src=":imy.png" alt="multi line">.
This is incorrect according to asciidoctor output.
--


[#v0_4_1__enhancements]
===  Enhancements

all: handle empty preamble::
+
If the document contains empty preamble do not output the HTML wrapper of it.


[#v0_4_0]
== asciidoctor-go v0.4.0 (2023-02-12)

[#v0_4_0_new_features]
===  New features

all: add support for document attribute "last-update-label"::
+
--
By default the last-update-label value set to "Last updated" and the value is
the document modification time.

If the label is suppressed with "!", no "Last updated" will be print on the
footer.
--


all: implement inline macro for passthrough ("pass:")::
+
--
The inline passthrough "pass:" can be used to control the substitutions
applied to a run of text.

Ref: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/pass/pass-macro/
--


all: implement macro "footnote:"::
+
--
Macro footnote grammar,

----
"footnote:" [ REF_ID ] "[" STRING "]"
----

In asciidoctor, footnote can be placed anywhere, even after WORD without
space in between.

The REF_ID, define the unique ID for footnote and can be used to reference
the previous footnote.
The first footnote with REF_ID, should have the STRING defined.
The next footnote with the same REF_ID, should not have the STRING
defined; if its defined, the STRING is ignored.
--


[#v0_4_0_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

all: detach parsing preamble from content::
+
This is to prevent empty preamble being rendered in HTML content.


all: fix the orders of generated HTML meta::
+
--
The meta tags from original asciidoctor are ordered as viewport, generator,
description, keywords, and then author.

While at it remove empty style tag due to when testing we use empty.css not
"stylesheet!".
--


[#v0_4_0_enhancements]
===  Enhancements

all: support multi line attribute values::
+
If the attribute value end with backslash '\\', the value continue to the
next line.


[#v0_3_2]
== asciidoctor-go v0.3.2 (2022-09-05)

[#v0_3_2_bug_fix]
===  Bug fix

all: fix parsing list description inside include directive::
+
--
Previously, given the following include statements in the main document

----
include::list_desc.adoc[]

include::list_desc.adoc[]
----

Where list_desc.adoc content is,

----
Item 00::
+
--
* Bullet 0
+
Description 0.

* Bullet 1
--
----

The first include is parsed correctly, but the second include is parsed
as is.
--

[#v0_3_2_chores]
=== Chores

all: update share module to v0.41.0::

all: move all documentation into directory _doc::
+
While at it reformat the README, add section for development, add
link for Go documentation.


[#v0_3_1]
== asciidoctor-go v0.3.1 (2022-08-06)

[#v0_3_1_chores]
===  Chores

all: rewrite unit tests for inlineParser using test.Data::
+
--
Using string literal for testing string input that may contains backtick
or double quote make the test code become unreadable and hard to modify.

The test.Data help this by moving the input and expected output into
a file that can we write as is.
--

all: cleaning up codes:: Use raw string literal whenever possible.

go.mod: update share to v0.40.0::
+
--
This update fix some issues related to new line on test.Data.
--


[#v0_3_0]
== asciidoctor-go v0.3.0 (2022-07-24)

This release set the minimum Go version to 1.18.

[#v0_3_0_breaking_changes]
===  Breaking changes

all: refactoring handling generate ref ID::
+
--
Previously, we always set the ID prefix and separator default to "\_" if
its not set, this cause all of the ID is prefixed with "\_".

This changes use strict rules when generating ID following the Mozilla
specification [1] and latest AsciiDoc Language [2].

The idprefix must be ASCII string.
It must start with "\_", "-", or ASCII letters, otherwise the "\_" will
be added to the beginning.
If one of the character is not valid, it will replaced with "\_".

The `idseparator` can be empty or single ASCII character ('\_' or '-',
ASCII letter, or digit).
It is used to replace invalid characters in the REF_ID.

[#v0_3_0_enhancements]
===  Enhancements

all: sort the generated HTML meta by names::
+
--
The order of meta names are "author", "description", "generator", and
then "keywords".
--

all: store the list of author names under Attributes "author_names"::
+
--
Previously, to get list of author names, we need to iterate each of
the Authors field.

This changes set the Attributes "author_names" to list of author full
names, each separated by comma.
--

all: add default metadata "generator"::
+
--
The generator metadata contains the library name and its current version.
--

all: realign all structs::
+
--
This is to minimize memory allocation when using asciidoctor.
--

[#v0_3_0_chores]
===  Chores

all: rewrite test using lib/test.Data::
+
--
Previously, to test parser and check the generated HTML, we write AsciDoc
input and expected HTML output using literal string `...`.
The text of input and output sometimes long, take multiple lines, which
makes the test code ugly, hard to write, and read.

Using lib/test.Data we can write the input and output as the AsciiDoc
markup and the HTML markup as is, simplify writing the test and more
readable.
--


[#v0_2_0]
== asciidoctor-go v0.2.0 (2022-03-04)

This release changes the license of asciidoctor-go from BSD to GPL 3.0 or
later.

[#v0_2_0_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

all: fix list check box text get cut one character::
+
--
Given the following asciidoc check box markup,

	* [ ] abc

It will rendereded as "&#10063; bc" instead of "&#10063; abc".
--

[#v0_2_0_chores]
===  Chores

all: replace bytes.Title and strings.Title with function::
+
--
Both of those functions has been deprecated.

Since the Title function is to convert the adminition string into a
human title (first letter uppercase), we can use a function to do that.
Any unknown admonition will be returned as is.
--


[#v0_1_1]
==  asciidoctor-go v0.1.1 (2021-12-06)


[#v0_1_1_bug_fixes]
=== Bug fixes

all: fix parsing and rendering cross reference::
+
--
Previously, when parsing cross reference we assume that if the string
contains upper-case letter then it's a label so we store it as title
to search for ID later.

The bug is when ID is set manually and its contains upper-case for
example "[#Id]".

This changes fix this issue by storing cross reference first, not
assuming it as ID or title, and then when doing rendering we check
whether its ID or title.
--

all: allow colon ':' and  period '.' on the ID::
+
--
According to XML spec [1], the colon is allowed as the first and the next
character.  While period is only allowed on the next characters.

[#v0_1_0]
==  asciidoctor-go v0.1.0 (2021-03-06)

The asciidoctor-go is the Go module to parse the AsciiDoc (TM) markup
and convert it into HTML5.

This first release bring almost all AsciiDoc syntax except for include
directive, inter-document cross-reference, macros, and non-primary syntax
features.

I hope this library can be useful for Gophers who need the power of AsciiDoc
in their workflows.
